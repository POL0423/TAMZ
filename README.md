# TAMZ
Demonstration project for TAMZ. Chosen topic is a weather forecast app.

## Premises
Project demonstrates how an Android app presents weather forecast data
in a nice graphic way. Set premises are as follows:
- Users get to choose location for the forecast (including GPS triangulation).
- Weather forecast data are taken from CHMI open data API.
- Data are presented in immediate next forecast (this evening, night,
  or tomorrow morning), the next 24 hours, and the next 7 days.
- Graphics are simple and easy to understand

## Goals
- [ ] Basic skeleton (note for myself: deadline 2024-12-22 22:59 UTC)
  - [x] Base key visual parts of the app (pages)
  - [x] Menu to glue those pages
  - [ ] Graphic icons, the app icon, aesthetics
    - [x] App icon (launcher, status bar)
    - [x] Menu icons
    - [x] Weather icons
    - [ ] Weather cards
  - [ ] Translation keys and their default values
    - [x] Partial setting (in progress)
  - [ ] Settings and their persistence
- [ ] Finalization (note for myself: deadline before the exams period)
  - [ ] API functionality (data from CHMI)
  - [ ] Dynamic generation of present layer from aquired data
  - [ ] Testing in a real device (Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro)
  - [ ] Optionally translation to Czech language (not required to pass)

## Development notes
### 2024-12-22 20:00 UTC
I have greatly underestimated complexness of this task and thus
failed to deliver complete basic skeleton of this app. The basic
skeleton is half baked as of this time when writing this note.
I couldn't get to finish all promised features on time until
the deadline, however the basic idea is still somewhat visible.
Hopefully this is gonna be enough to count towards the minimum
credit score.

## Presentation
The presentation is probably going to be done before the final exams.
Deadline is yet to be exactly specified, however I know it should be
somewhen at the start of January.
