# TAMZ
Demonstration project for TAMZ. Chosen topic is a weather forecast app.

## Premises
Project demonstrates how an Android app presents weather forecast data
in a nice graphic way. Set premises are as follows:
- Users get to choose location for the forecast (including GPS triangulation).
- Weather forecast data are taken from CHMI open data API.
- Data are presented in immediate next forecast (this evening, night,
  or tomorrow morning), the next 24 hours, and the next 7 days.
- Graphics are simple and easy to understand

## Goals
- [ ] Basic skeleton (note for myself: deadline 2024-12-22 22:59 UTC)
    - [ ] Base key visual parts of the app (pages)
    - [ ] Menu to glue those pages
    - [ ] Graphic icons, the app icon, aesthetics
    - [ ] Translation keys and their default values
    - [ ] Settings and their persistence
- [ ] Finalization (note for myself: deadline before the exams period)
    - [ ] API functionality (data from CHMI)
    - [ ] Dynamic generation of present layer from aquired data
    - [ ] Testing in a real device (Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro)
    - [ ] Optionally translation to Czech language (not required to pass)

## Presentation
The presentation is probably going to be done before the final exams.
Deadline is yet to be exactly specified, however I know it should be
somewhen at the start of January.
